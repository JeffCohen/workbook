# Fonts

Fonts are specified with the `font-family`, `font-size`, and `font-weight`
properties.  Well, there are many others, but that's enough to get started.
(For more properties, Google is your friend).

``` css

body {
  font-family: 'Arial';
  font-size: '20px';
}

li {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Notice how the `li` items will inherit the font characteristics of the parent
HTML elements.
