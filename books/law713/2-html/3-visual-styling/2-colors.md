# Colors

In your `styles.css` file, add the following line of code:

> Don't see any change?  Make sure your `<link>` element
is pointing to the correct `styles.css` file.

``` css
body {
  color: red;
}
```

Save the file, and refresh your HTML file.  All of the text
should now be red!

## Multiple Properties

Change the selector to `h1` and add several properties:

> Play around!  Change the colors and sizes in this rule
to discover how they work.

``` css
h1 {
  color: red;
  border-bottom: 4px solid green;
  padding-bottom: 6px;
}
```


Refresh your browser again, and notice the difference.
Congratulations, your `h1` element is now the ugliest heading
on the internet.
