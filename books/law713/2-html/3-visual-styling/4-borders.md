# Borders

You can place borders around elements:

``` css

ul {
  border: solid 3px green;
}
```

You can also control the amount of whitespace on each side of the
border line.  Use `padding` to give a little breathing space
between the border and the interior content:

``` css
ul {
  border: solid 3px green;
  padding: 6px;
}
```

Use `margin` for the outer spacing:

``` css
ul {
  border: solid 3px green;
  padding: 6px;
  margin-left: 12px;
}
```
