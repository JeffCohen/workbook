# Else

We can also specify what should happen when the comparison provided
in the `if` statement evaulates to `false`:

``` ruby
number = rand(1..5)

print "Today's number is: #{number} \n"   

if n == 3
  print "Congratulations!! \n"
else
  print "Sorry, that's not the secret number. \n"
end

print "Finished. \n"
```
