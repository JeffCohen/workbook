# Overview

Every website you encounter on the internet is, technically speaking, simply
a set of _resources_.

A _resource_ is anything that a user finds valuable.  It's a reason for the user
to visit the website or application. Resources are always _nouns_.

Think of Amazon.com.  What resources can we identify?

* Products
* Orders
* Reviews
* Deals
* Departments
* Shipments
* Users
* Credit Cards
* Wish Lists

...just to name a few.
