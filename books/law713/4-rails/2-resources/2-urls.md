# Resource Locators

A URL is more than just cryptic text in our browser's address bar.  A URL
uniquely identifies a resource on the internet.  Kind of amazing when you
think about it.  There are a billion resources on the internet, but
this URL takes you instantly to the arrival times for CTA trains
at the Grand Ave. station: http://www.transitchicago.com/traintracker/arrivaltimes.aspx?sid=40330

URLs can look complicated but they can be simple.  Imagine if we were building
Amazon ourselves.  We would invent one URL per resource:

* /products
* /orders
* /shipments
* /payments

And so on.
