# Text Editing

This video will help you get familiar with how to write code.  There are two things to remember:

* Use the keyboard instead of your mouse/trackpad whenever possible.
* If you use a menu item, notice the hotkey (if any) so that you can use the keyboard next time.
* Use `Shift-Cmd-P` (macOS) or `Shift-Ctrl-P` (Windows) to activate the command palette.

## Self-Assessment

After editing code for a while, can you...

* Start a new file
* Set the filetype to "HTML" or "Ruby"
* Select a region of text using only the keyboard
* Indent several lines of text at once
* Un-indent several lines of text at once
* Use the `File` menu to open an entire folder of code
* Delete an entire line using only the keyboard
* Duplicate a line using the keyboard
