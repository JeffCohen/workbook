# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Howdy!

Every software engineer uses a set of tools necessary for constructing
software.  This toolset is called a _development environment_, and
the it can be daunting to set up an environment for the very first time.

You don't need to install everything before the first day of class,
but in order to follow along on the first day, do one of the following:


* [First Day Setup Instructions for Windows](/1-setup/1-introduction/2-first-day:-windows) or
* [First Day Setup Instructions for macOS](/1-setup/1-introduction/3-first-day:-macos).

Then, prior to Week 2, you should also complete your setup with:

* [Windows Complete Setup](/1-setup/1-introduction/4-windows-complete/) or
* [macOS Complete Setup](/1-setup/1-introduction/5-macos-complete/).

If neither of these work, let me know and also see the section on [Alternatives]('6-alternatives').
