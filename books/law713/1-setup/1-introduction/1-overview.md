software.  This toolset is called a _development environment_, and
the it can be daunting to set up an environment for the very first time.

The key to success in setting up your environment is to work slowly,
attentively, and methodically.  You should expect
it to take about an hour to get your environment setup.  Any issues
that arise are usually solvable, but if you're not paying attention
or if you are trying to speed through the process, you'll just make matters worse.

Specific instructions vary depending on whether you're using Windows or macOS.
