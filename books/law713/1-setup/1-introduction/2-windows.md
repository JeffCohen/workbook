# Setup on Windows

This entire process can take 90 minutes.  You don't have to do it all at once.

In fact for the first homework assignment, you only need to complete steps 1, 2 and 3.  You can save the rest for later if you prefer.

## STEP 1: Install Google Chrome

This step is actually optional, but I'll be using Chrome in class.  If you decide to
use Edge, Firefox, or Safari, just know that some things might look slightly
different.  You can get it from https://www.google.com/chrome/.


## STEP 2: GitHub Account (5 minutes)

1. Use your NU email address for a free Student Pack at [GitHub.com](https://education.github.com/pack).  Use it to sign up
for a free GitHub account.  They will probably require
you to confirm your .edu email address.
2. Once signed in, go to your [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and select your NU email
address to be your **Public email** address, _then scroll down and click
the **Update profile** button_.

## STEP 3: Install a Text Editor (5 minutes)

Install Atom from [atom.io](atom.io).  Once installed, it should automatically
launch.  You can uncheck the "Always Show This Welcome Page" option and close
all of the tabs.

Turn on the Autosave feature:

1. Go to the `File` menu and click `Settings`.  A big two-panel control
   panel will show up.
2. Click on `Core` on the left side, then uncheck `Audio Beep`.
3. Click on `Packages` on the left side, and search for `Autosave`.
   You should now see the "autosave" package listed under "Core Packages."
4. Click the small `Settings` button in the package widget.
5. Check the box that says `Enabled`


## STEP 4: Active the "Windows Subsystem for Linux"

1. Turn on "Windows Subsystem for Linux"
1. Restart


## STEP 5: Install the Ruby on Rails Environment (30 minutes)

First, watch this video:


Here are the formal instructions:

1. Start bash
1. `curl -sL ......`
1. Start the sample app
1. Press `CTRL-C`

## STEP 6: Configure Version Control

And finally, let's setup your Git version control system.

Substitute your name and your NU email address below.

   ```
   git config --global color.ui true
   git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
   git config --global user.email "YOUR@EMAIL.com"
   ```

Congratulations, you're all set!
