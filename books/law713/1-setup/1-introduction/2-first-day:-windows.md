# Setup on Windows: First Day

This chapter will prepare you for the first day of class.

## STEP 0: Update Windows 10 to version 1709, build 16299

Make sure you have the latest version of Windows.  Here's a screenshot of what to look for, as well as a screencast if you're not sure how to check the version.

## STEP 1: Install Google Chrome

You can get it from https://www.google.com/chrome/. This step is actually optional,
but I'll be using Chrome in class.  If you decide to use Edge, Firefox, or Safari,
just know that some things might look slightly different.  


## STEP 2: GitHub Account (5 minutes)

1. Use your NU email address for a free Student Pack at [GitHub.com](https://education.github.com/pack).  Use it to sign up
for a free GitHub account.  They will probably require
you to confirm your .edu email address, which might take minutes but sometimes
takes a day or two.  Watch your inbox for a confirmation email.

2. Once you have signed in, go to your [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and select your NU email
address to be your **Public email** address, _then scroll down and click
the **Update profile** button_.

## STEP 3: Install a Text Editor (5 minutes)

Install Atom from [atom.io](atom.io).  Once installed, it should automatically
launch.  You can uncheck the "Always Show This Welcome Page" option and close
all of the tabs.

Turn on the Autosave feature:

1. Go to the `File` menu and click `Settings`.  A big two-panel control
   panel will show up.
2. Click on `Core` on the left side, then uncheck `Audio Beep`.
3. Click on `Packages` on the left side, and search for `Autosave`.
   You should now see the "autosave" package listed under "Core Packages."
4. Click the small `Settings` button in the package widget.
5. Check the box that says `Enabled`

## STEP 4: Install Ubuntu-on-Windows

First, click `Start` and then the `Settings` gear, then search for "Turn Windows Features
On or Off".  This should bring up another dialog box.  Scroll the bottom
and check the box that says "Windows Subsystem for Linux".  Then click `OK`
and then click `Restart`.

When your computer has restarted and is ready again, go to the Microsoft Store
and install the "Ubuntu" app.  Once it's downloaded, click "Launch".  After a few
minutes, it will ask you to invent a Linux username and password.  It doesn't
really matter what you use here, so pick something very simple and easy to remember
(security is not a concern here).

That's it!  You're ready for class.
