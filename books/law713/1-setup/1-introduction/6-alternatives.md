# Alternatives

If you have trouble installing the recommended development
toolset onto your computer, there are online alternatives that
you can use to do your homework.  

These tools allow you to do all of your coding in your browser,
which can be very convenient; but you should expect a few
drawbacks:

1. It won't be the same tools that I'm using in class, so
you'll be on your own for figuring out how to use them.
2. They probably won't have the same conveniences of the
installed toolset.
3. I'm not expert with these online tools, so I can't guarantee
any help if you get stuck
4. You are still required to turn in homework in the same
fashion as everyone else.


## Text Editor

I've never heard of anyone not being able to install Atom,
but if for some reason you need an alternative, here are some ideas:

* Windows: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* Mac: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)

## Ruby

This cool site has a side-by-side file-based scripting editor along with an `irb` session: https://repl.it/languages/ruby  

I recommend using your GitHub
account to sign in, so that you can save your work.

## HTML/CSS

* codepen.io
* https://repl.it/languages/web_project (I recommend using your GitHub
account to sign in, so that you can save your work)

## Rails

The only viable option that I know of is [Cloud9](https://c9.io).  

Sign up requires a credit card but you can remain on the free plan, so your card
will never actually be charged.

If you need to use use Cloud9, schedule an appointment with me so that
I can give you a brief orientation to Cloud9.
