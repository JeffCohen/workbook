# Getting Oriented to the Cloud9 IDE

Coding in a browser can be a bit frustrating for those of us accustomed to a
full-featured code editor like Atom.  The Cloud9 IDE has a lot of moving parts, but most of them can be ignored most of the time.


Start by going to your Preferences, and slowly walk through everything to see
what's customizable.

In particular, I suggest:

* Remap the shortcut key for `Close Tab` to something that won't conflict with the
  browser's built-in shortcut for closing the browser's tab.  I use `Cmd-2` since it
  is right near the `Cmd-W` that I would otherwise prefer.
* Change the tab width when editing files to 2 spaces instead of 4 spaces.
* Pick a color scheme that you like.

## Using the IDE

Most of you Atom shortcut keys will also work in Cloud9.  The biggest difference
is that a few of them are unfortunately intercepted by the browser instead.

Take 20 minutes and get comfortable with the following:

* Creating new files by right-clicking in the folder tree or with `File > New`
* Editing code
* Saving your changes with `Cmd-s` (on Mac) or `Ctrl-s` (on Windows)
* Open existing files via `Cmd-e` (on Mac) or `Ctrl-e` (on Windows)
* Opening new Terminal windows
* Toggling the treeview with the "Environment" tab (extreme upper-left)
* Toggling the Terminal area with `Ctrl-Esc` or `View > Console`


## Self-Assessment

After editing code for a while, can you...

* Start a new file
* Set the filetype to "HTML" or "Ruby"
* Select a region of text using only the keyboard
* Indent several lines of text at once
* Save your code without using the mouse
* Un-indent several lines of text at once
* Delete an entire line using only the keyboard
* Duplicate a line using the keyboard
