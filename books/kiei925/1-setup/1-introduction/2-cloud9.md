# Cloud9 Setup

This page will prepare you for the first day of class.

In order to complete this setup, you will need:

* Your NU NetID (see me if you do not have a NetID)
* The super-secret password, which is `student`
* A modern browser such as Google Chrome

## Step 1: Login to Cloud9

1. Go to [https://kiei925.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://kiei925.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)
   <%= tiny_thumbnail_for 'https://www.evernote.com/l/AAbpf8GLgZ5ExKrM9tQaNafdQNqOdBdqV5MB/image.png' %>
2. The account ID should already be filled in as `kiei925`
3. For `IAM user name`, enter your NU NetID
4. For `Password`, enter the word `student`

You might be asked to change your password the first time you login.


## Step 2: Create Your Development Environment

If all went well, you will probably see this confusing "console" screen:

Search for the service named "Cloud9" and select it:

And now, click the "Create Environment" button:

Give it the name `classroom` and click "Next Step" (all lowercase, just as you see in the screenshot):

<p><%= image_for 'https://www.evernote.com/l/AAZxSozFdJVC-7jKT2heSa29WghN23ym-6oB/image.png' %></p>

Leave all of the defaults selected for "Environment settings" and just click "Next Step"
again.

You'll get to another review page.  Click "Create Environment".

It can take a few minutes for this process to finish.  When it's complete, you'll see
your "IDE" appear, at which point you are ready to [install a few last tools](3-tools.md).
