# Need Help?

If you get stuck or have trouble, join #kiei-925 channel on
on [Slack](https://kellogg-mba.slack.com/messages/C3QQZ19NX/).

TIPS to getting help:

* Provide the most relevant error message as plain text.  Do NOT attach a
screenshot of an error message.
* If the error message hints at an offending line of code,
  also paste that line of code into your question.
