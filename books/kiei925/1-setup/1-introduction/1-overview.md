# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Every software engineer uses a set of tools necessary for constructing

that is entirely online, or "in the cloud" as they say.

These instructions assume that you are using the latest version of
Google Chrome.

Once that's done, use your Cloud9 terminal to setup a few extra [tools](/1-setup/1-introduction/3-tools.md).
