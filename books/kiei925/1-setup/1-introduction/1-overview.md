# Overview

Every software engineer uses a set of tools necessary for constructing
software.  This toolset is called a _development environment_. It can be
daunting to set up an environment for the very first time.

This quarter, we will experiment together by trying a development environment
that is entirely online, or "in the cloud" as they say: Amazon Cloud9.  This will save us
from having to install a lot of software on our personal laptops. It also means
that we will do all of our work inside of a browser tab, which can feel odd at times.

You do not need to sign up for an account,
because I've already added you into a team account that I've setup for KIEI-925.
Howver, you can [read more about Cloud9 here](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/).  

As soon as you're ready, follow the [setup instructions for Cloud9](/1-setup/1-introduction/2-cloud9.md).  It will take about 8 minutes.

Once that's done, use your Cloud9 terminal to setup a few extra [tools](/1-setup/1-introduction/3-tools.md).
