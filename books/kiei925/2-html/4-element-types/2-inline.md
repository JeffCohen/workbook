# Inline Elements

Inline elements are drawn "next to" the previous element.

``` html
<p>Hello <em>World!</em> Goodbye.</p>
```

Here, "World!" is drawn alongside "Hello" becase `em` is an inline
element.

Inline elements only take up the minimum width necessary based
on their content (plus any padding).

Common inline elements:

* `a`
* `img`
* `span`
* `em`
* `strong`
