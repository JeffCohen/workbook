# First Steps

Let's learn some HTML!

Quick facts:

* HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  Invented in the early 1990's,
  researchers were looking for a way plain-text documents to contain
  "hyperlinks," a new invention to replace footnotes. Hyperlinks allowed
  readers to simply click a word to have the relevant cross-referenced
  document loaded, rather than having old-style footnotes at the bottom
  of the page or chapter.

> See [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) for a comprehensive
  HTML reference.


* HTML has undergone many revisions since.  We will be using HTML 5.
  Modern HTML provides a way to completely "mark up" a document's
  content to denote the start and end of headings, paragraphs,
  bullet lists, images, and more.

* Important terminology:

  * Element
  * Attribute
  * Opening Tag
  * Closing Tag
  * Content
  * Document
  * Head
  * Body
