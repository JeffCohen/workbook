# HTTP Methods

Also known as "verbs", an HTTP "method" indicates the way in which
a given resource is to be consumed or manipulated.

We will start by using the `GET` verb for all of our URLs, which is fine
when we are first learning how to build web applications.  

Professional-grade
applications utilize all four verbs depending on the situation.  Using
the proper verb increases security and usability by other web services.


|Method|Meaning|
|------|-------|
|`GET`|Retrieve resource data|    
|`POST`|Add new resource|    
|`PATCH`|Update existing resource|    
|`DELETE`|Delete existing resource|
