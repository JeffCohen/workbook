# Overview

A _database_ is like a spreadsheet workbook.

* A database contains a series of _tables_.  
* Each table contains a series of _columns_.
* Columns have a _name_ and a _data type_.  
* Common data types are _text_, _integer_, _date_, and _boolean_.

The developer dictates the _schema_, which is the names of all of the
tables and all of the column definitions.  The developer might also
_seed_ one or more tables with an initial set of rows.

Website visitors cannot modify the schema.  But they may be
allowed to create, update, and delete rows.

It might sound too simple, but that's the entirety of what users
can do on the web: they can add, update, and edit rows in a table
that resides inside of a computer database.  

A web application is therefore nothing more than a nice-looking
record-keeping system.
