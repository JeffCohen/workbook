# Text Editing

The best way to learn how to write code is to... write a lot of code.  

A few tips:

* Use the keyboard instead of your mouse/trackpad whenever possible.
* If you use a menu item, notice the hotkey (if any) so that you can use the keyboard next time.

If you're using Atom, Sublime, or VS Code:

* Use `Shift-Cmd-P` (macOS) or `Shift-Ctrl-P` (Windows) to activate the command palette
* Use `Cmd-P` (macOS) or `Ctrl-P` (Windows) to instantly open any file in your project
* Learn how to assign a keyboard short to the Duplicate Line or Duplicate Selection command (I suggest `Shift-Cmd-D`)

## Self-Assessment

After editing code for a while, can you...

* Start a new file
* Set the type of file to "HTML" or "Ruby"
* Select a region of text using only the keyboard
* Indent several lines of text at once using only the keyboard
* Un-indent several lines of text at once using only the keyboard
* Delete an entire line using only the keyboard
* Duplicate a line using the keyboard
