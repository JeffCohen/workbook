# Lists

In daily life, *lists* are all around us.  Grocery lists.
To-do lists. A dinner recipe has two lists: one for the
ingredients, and one for the cooking directions.  Your bookshelf
is a list of books.  There's a stack of plates in your cupboard.
An analog clock displays a circularly-arranged list of numbers
on its face.

Most of computer programming boils down to
managing a bunch of lists.  You can see this every day
on the internet.  Just visit your favorite website and lists
will appear like stars in the night sky: the longer you look,
the more you'll see.

Consider:
* The navigation bar at the top of this site is a list of links.
* This bullet list is, well, a list.
* Go to your Amazon order history.  Yup, it's a list.
* Google for something.  You get a list.
* Go to your Facebook or Twitter page.  Lots of lists.

It behooves us, then, to be comfortable with how to manage
lists with Ruby.

## Common Traits

All lists in Ruby have three things in common:

* They have a _length_
* They allow you to _access_ a single item from the list
* They allow you to _iterate_ over each item in the list

We will learn about iteration in [section 3](/3-intelligence).


The following chapters will show how to obtain the length
and access items of strings, arrays, and hashes.
