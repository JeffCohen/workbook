# HTML Template

Most HTML pages have the same skeleton structure.  Here's
a snippet of code that you can use in every new HTML page:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

Starting from this, you can then change the `title` content
and add your HTML elements inside of the `body`.

## Bonus: Atom Snippet

If Atom knows that you're writing HTML (check the file type indicator
in the status bar of your editor), you can have Atom type out this
entire skeleton for you.  Just type the letters `html` followed
immediately by the `[TAB]` key.  

If the file type is something else, like Plain Text, it could be
that you haven't saved your file yet so Atom doesn't know yet
what kind of code you're writing.  You can simply click the indicator
to bring up a (very) long list of programming languages so
you can select "HTML".
