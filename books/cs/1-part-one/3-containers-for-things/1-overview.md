# Containers for Things, _also known as_ Data Structures

Digital computing was invented in the 1940's, when physical computing devices (such as adding machines and simple calculators) were the state of the art.  

Those devices were pre-wired to perform their function.  A calculator built to add and subtract integers, which would then transform itself into a machine that could also multiply and divide, would have sounded like some sort of dark magic.

The invention of electronic programmability changed that worldview forever.  Computing machines could be now pre-wired to follow instructions that would be provided later, electronically.

Electronic data storage pioneered the age of software.  The days of "unitasker" computing devices were immediately numbered and the realm of computing took a giant leap forward. But soon it became clear that the art of organizing electronic data was not at all obvious.  

How should data be organized?  Should all data be organized in the same way? Must the technique of storing data be connected to the manner in which that data will be used to perform the calculations?

Over 70 years of such questions - and answers - have defined the data structures we use today.  

A raw inventory of data structures is not helpful.  They can be found in any computer programming textbook worth it's weight in paper (or bandwidth).  

But to be able to glimpse the insights that produced such structures in the first place is priceless.  The dual dedication to laws of both simplicity and power is one of the best parts of the tradition of computer science.  

This chapter aims to illuminate the fundamental structures that we still use today, and to make clear the utmost importance these structures have on modern computational architectures today.
