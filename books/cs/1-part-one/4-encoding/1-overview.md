# Encoding

_Encoding_ is how we represent real-world information in a manner suitable for computer consumption.

But encoding wasn't invented because of computers.  The act of encoding something is an age-old tradition.  Thousands of years ago, our human ancestors invented language.  Language is one way in which we try to represent thoughts and ideas in a manner suitable for another human being to consume.

Initially, a non-verbal gesture such as wildly pointing to the cave opening, complete with an wide-eyed glances, probably meant "watch out, there's a big lion right outside the door!"  That gesture was an intuitive _encoding_ of the idea that there's a danger lurking nearby.

In more recent times, looms were invented to encode textile pattern instructions into physical machinery, so that a wide variety of products could be produced in a predictable, repeatable fashion, and with much less effort than hand-weaving.  

Such weaving instructions, once given to human operators, were encoded into mechanical arms and levelers - and later, paper punch cards - long before Alan Turing imagined the mashup of electronic relays and Babbage's analytical engine would resemble anything close to a computer.
