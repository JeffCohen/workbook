# Finding the Boundaries Within

However, knowing how to break a problem into pieces can be a problem unto itself.  The insight required to split a problem into pieces can be more art than science.  

Imagine a very large boulder that has just rolled down a cliff, and is now blocking the road.  Moving the boulder would be nearly impossible without very large equipment.  But after some experience with large boulders, natural fault lines can quickly be recognized.  It is along these lines that the boulder can be split apart; and after repeating this process a few times, the small chunks of leftover rock are easily removed.

Finding the natural fault lines of an intractable bug or complex feature implementation is an essential practice of applied software engineering.  Much of the rest of this chapter, and indeed the rest of this book, is devoted to offering a wealth of strategies and techniques for breaking problems down to size.
