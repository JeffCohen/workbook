# Welcome

As practitioners, we already know how to build software.  But from time to time, we
can still come up against terminology we don't know. There are concepts we might
be afraid to admit we haven't learned.  

You might be in you favorite Slack channel one day,
happily reacting to the latest team's endeavors with the newest emoji, and
then suddenly, a daunting question appears:

_"Anybody know if blockchain could help us with this?"_

The term _blockchain_ rings a bell, but you don't feel qualified to chime in.
So you say nothing, and after a while another team member replies with,

_"I think that's overkill.  Our current algorithm is polynomial so
it shouldn't be a problem."_

It's at this point you're tempted to just close Slack entirely and get back to work, hoping
nobody else realizes that you're not quite sure what everyone is talking about.

In this book, we will look at the fundamental ideas and building blocks
of computer science - but not with an academic, theory-based or math-based approach.
This book is not an exhaustive, biblical reference of all things computer science.  

Instead, this book aims to provide simple, short definitions of the best topics in CS.
These are the ideas and topics that you may have heard of but were afraid to ask about.
In part one, we cover the core ideas that every practicing developer should
understand.  In part two, we dig into specific practices and practical applications
of topics in computer science that dominate the landscape today.
