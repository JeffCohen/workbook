## Neural Networks

Graphs are sometimes called _networks_ because they are often used to simulate the behavior of a flow network, whether it's a city's water pipe system, an electronic circuit, or a computer network.

One type of network that's often used as an introduction to the field of artificial intelligence is the _neural network_.
