# Trees

* Use iteration to implement a binary tree to solve the following problems.
  * **Dictionary lookup**.  Load the Oxford dictionary into a tree.
  Compare `O()` complexity vs a linked list.
  * **Game of 20 Questions**.  You vs. computer.
* Now use recursion instead of iteration.

Discussion:

* Which operations perform better/worse with recursion?
* Which implementation is easier to read and understand?
* How would you save a binary tree to disk, so that you can reload it later?
