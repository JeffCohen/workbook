# MapReduce

In the same way that the invention of the loop vaulted computer science forward, we could say much the same for the _Map-Reduce algorithm_.  To call it an algorithm is correct - it's a recipe for performing work - but it could also be considered to be a design pattern, because it succeeds at solving so many different kinds of problems.  

To get a real-world sense of the simplicity and power of map-reduce, we begin by considering the following small data set:

[DATA SET HERE]

And now we consider the question, [QUESTION HERE].

We realize that we can come up with the answer by breaking up the solution into two small steps.  First, we we transform the original data set into a new one:

(REVISED DATA SET)

Now that the data is organized this way, it's easy to find the answer by _reducing_ the key data characteristic.
